// notes:

// EXPLICIT StudioInstructor model: would allow for metadata on the studio to instructor relationship, i.e. who created to instrucor role at a studio or added/subtracted permissions of an instructor at a studio 
// model StudioInstructor {
//   studioId     Int
//   instructorId Int
//   studio       Studio    @relation(fields: [studioId], references: [userId])
//   instructor   Instructor @relation(fields: [instructorId], references: [userId])
//   @@id([studioId, instructorId])
// }

// Creating a separate `Schedule` model can bring several benefits compared to having `startTime`, `endTime`, and `dayOfWeek` fields directly on the `DanceClass` model. Here are some considerations:

// 1. **Flexibility**:
//    - With a separate `Schedule` model, you can handle multiple schedule entries for a single `DanceClass`. This can be useful if a dance class meets at different times on different days.
//    - It allows for more complex scheduling scenarios such as classes that meet bi-weekly, or have differing schedules through the year.

// 2. **Normalization**:
//    - Database normalization helps to eliminate redundancy and inconsistent dependency by organizing data in database tables.
//    - By separating schedules into their own model, you can maintain a cleaner, normalized database schema which adheres to good database design practices.

// 3. **Ease of Updating**:
//    - It’s easier to manage and update schedules independently without affecting the `DanceClass` table.
//    - This separation can help reduce the complexity and potential errors when updating class schedules.

// 4. **Reusability**:
//    - If schedules are stored separately, they could potentially be reused for different dance classes or other scheduled entities within the system.

// 5. **Query Efficiency**:
//    - Having a separate `Schedule` model can lead to more efficient queries, as you can fetch or update schedule information without touching the `DanceClass` table.
//    - This is particularly useful in larger systems or systems with a lot of database traffic.

// 6. **Extensibility**:
//    - If in the future, scheduling needs become more complex (e.g., adding location, instructor availability, special notes for certain days), having a separate `Schedule` model makes it easier to extend the schema to accommodate these new requirements.

// 7. **Clearer Relations**:
//    - With a `Schedule` model, you can clearly define the relationship between a dance class and its schedule(s), which can be more intuitive and self-explanatory for others (or future-you) working on the project.

// These are general benefits and the actual impact may vary based on the specific requirements and scale of your application.

// Creating a separate `Enrollment` model as a junction table between `DanceClass` and `Dancer` models offers several advantages over directly connecting `Dancer` to `DanceClass` with an array field. Here are some reasons why this approach is better:

// 1. **Rich Relationships**:
//    - An `Enrollment` model can store additional information about the relationship between a `Dancer` and a `DanceClass`. For instance, it might store the date of enrollment, attendance records, performance grades, or any other relevant information.
//    - This provides a rich relationship that can evolve over time as the application's requirements change.

// 2. **Database Normalization**:
//    - Using a junction table like `Enrollment` is a normalized approach that helps maintain data integrity and consistency in many-to-many relationships.
//    - It's a common practice in database design, making your schema more understandable and maintainable.

// 3. **Scalability**:
//    - As the number of dancers and classes grows, a separate `Enrollment` model helps to keep the database organized and querying efficient.
//    - Direct arrays can become problematic in terms of performance and management in larger datasets.

// 4. **Ease of Querying**:
//    - It’s easier and more efficient to query, update, or delete relationships through a dedicated `Enrollment` model.
//    - Complex queries and joins are more straightforward with this kind of setup.

// 5. **Extensibility**:
//    - If your application evolves to include new features or data points related to a dancer's enrollment in a class, having a separate `Enrollment` model makes it easier to extend the schema.

// 6. **Data Integrity**:
//    - An `Enrollment` model helps ensure data integrity by clearly defining the relationships and potentially setting up cascading deletes or updates.

// 7. **Consistency**:
//    - This approach promotes a consistent way of handling many-to-many relationships throughout your application, which is beneficial for code maintainability and readability.

// These advantages make the `Enrollment` model a more robust and flexible choice for managing the many-to-many relationship between dancers and dance classes in your web application.
